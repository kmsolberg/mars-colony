## Personal Learnings
- Typescript is very helpful for creating multiple pages within one application, is sometimes a lot more instinctual that javascript.
- Naming classes, components etc is a lot more intricate and complex than it may originally seem, and using good naming classes is key for helping everything run smoothly long-term so you don't have to go back and rewrite some code.
- This project helped me realize how important it is to pay attention to the smallest details.
- Design requires a lot more thought than I originally gave it credit for.
- Google does not always have all the answer.
